# Personalization Roadmap

## Summary

Rebuild ONA's personalization layer in 9 tracks, shipped as 16 stacked PRs. The goal is to move ONA from AI-first / single-user to user-controllable / household-shared, without breaking production. Two PRs are load-bearing and must ship first; the rest can fan out from there.

## Load-bearing foundations (ship first, in parallel)

These two PRs unblock every other track. They don't touch each other so they can land in parallel.

- **PR 1 — Household foundation** ([detailed plan](./personalization-pr1-household.md))
  Adds `households` + `household_members` + `household_invites`. Every existing user gets backfilled into a solo household. Menus / shopping / pantry / favorites / cook logs all become household-scoped via the user's primary household. Invitation flow + `/household` page. Without this, every later feature has to redo scoping.

- **PR 2 — User memory foundation** ([detailed plan](./personalization-pr2-user-memory.md))
  First-class `user_memories` table (typed fact storage), `GET/PATCH/DELETE /memory` endpoints, a `/profile/memoria` editor page, and a memory-loader the advisor injects into every skill call. Track A's voice onboarding writes to this storage; the editor reads it back. Without this, the voice onboarding has nowhere to land.

## Sequencing recommendation

**Week 1** — PR 1 + PR 2 in parallel (different agents, no overlap). Land both before anything else.

**Week 2** — PR 5 (zero-dependency, pure value, small risk). PR 3 + PR 4 stack on PR 2. Run together.

**Week 3** — PR 6 (cook log, unblocks pantry auto-decrement + analytics) + PR 7 (recipe notes, customer-visible win).

**Week 4** — PR 10 (shopping power features) + PR 8 (recipe photos / tags / collections). Both shippable, mostly independent.

**Month 2** — PR 11 → 12 → 13 chain (pantry path culminates in OCR). PR 14 (real-time sync). PR 9 (community).

**Month 3** — PR 15 (advisor reads memory everywhere) + PR 16 (analytics) + PR 17 (a11y).

## Cross-cutting invariants

These apply to **every PR** below; they aren't tasks per-PR.

- **Spec gate**: every PR updates the relevant `specs/*.md` in the same commit. New tables → schema doc + new spec where needed. The spec describes the *current* reality of the code, not the future plan.
- **Test gate**: each PR ships at least one test that would fail if the bug returned. Unit tests for pure logic, integration / Playwright for multi-step flows. TDD where it pays (matchers, scorers, validators).
- **Production safety**: zero-downtime migrations only. Always nullable-add → backfill → set NOT NULL. Never `DROP COLUMN` without a deprecation cycle.
- **Mobile-first**: every UI change tested at 390×844 via Playwright MCP.
- **Spanish copy**: all user-facing strings in Spanish (Spain dialect: "comida" for lunch, "cena" for dinner, "merienda" for snack).
- **Editorial design tokens**: cream `#FAF6EE`, ink `#1A1612`, terracotta `#C65D38`, forest `#2D6A4F`. Use `@theme` tokens from `globals.css`.

## What lands first if you can only afford one PR

**PR 1 (household)**. It's the riskiest migration in the whole plan and it has to land before any other family-aware feature. If we delay it past two more PRs, we'll have to redo data scoping in those PRs to add household-awareness retroactively. Better to take the hit once.

PR 5 (menu shaping quick wins) is the cheapest customer-visible value with zero dependencies — pair it with PR 1 if there's bandwidth on a second agent.

## How to use these plans

1. Each detailed plan (`personalization-prN-*.md`) follows the implementation-plan template: flat task list ending in verification.
2. Run `/test-driven-development` against the chosen PR's plan to enter execution mode.
3. After each PR ships, refresh this roadmap (cross out completed PRs, adjust priorities based on user feedback).
